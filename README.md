## Introduction
Recent breakthroughs of large language models (LLMs) have exhibited superior capability across major industries and stimulated multi-hundred-billion-dollar investment in AI-centric data centers in the next 3-5 years. This, in turn, bring the increasing concerns on sustainability and AI-related power and energy usage. However, there is a largely overlooked issue as challenging and critical as AI model and infrastructure efficiency: the disruptive dynamic power consumption behaviour. With fast, transient dynamics, AI infrastructure features ultra-low inertia, sharp power surge and dip, and a significant peak-idle power ratio. We develop high-level mathematical models to depict AI workload behaviour and discuss the multifaceted challenges and opportunities they potentially bring to existing power grids. Observing the rapidly evolving machine learning (ML) and AI technologies, this project emphasizes the critical need for interdisciplinary approaches to ensure reliable and sustainable AI infrastructure development, and provides a starting point for researchers and practitioners to tackle such challenges.
